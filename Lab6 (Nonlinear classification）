# A non-linear classification task is accomplished by a support vector machine. The sample data here zoo.csv is from the UCI data website.
Zoo.csv is called the zoo dataset. There are 18 columns in total. The first column is the animal name and the last column is the animal classification.
The 16 columns in the data set are characteristic of the animal, such as whether there is hair, whether to lay eggs, and so on. Except for the number of legs, the remaining feature columns are all Boolean data. There are 7 categories of animals in the dataset, represented by the numbers in the last column.
Next, we try to accomplish this nonlinear multi-classification task with support vector machine. The first step is still to import the csv data file. Then define 16 columns as features and the last column as the target value.


import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA


# Import the data
data = pd.read_csv('zoo.csv', header=0)

# Defining feature variables and target variables
feature = data.iloc[:, 1:17].values
target = data['type'].values

# The data set is segmented, 70% for the training set and 30% for the test set.
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(feature, target, test_size=0.3, random_state=50)

# Build the model
model = SVC()

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Predection
results = model.predict(x_test)

print(model.score(x_test, y_test))

# result = 0.8666666666667
